Agile Requirements


Theme: Get GiggleGit demo into a stable enough alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients

pic: Onboarding experience


User story 1:
   As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to understand the features it offers relatively easy, so I can then see if I should use this version control system.


User story 2:
   As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want the people working on this project to be in sync with one another as far as developing, solving issues, and helping solve buisness needs.


User story 3:
   As a GiggleGit user using the platform often, it would be nice to have some authentication process so you can access your working repositories with the same settings.


   Ticket 1:
       Create authentication process allowing users to log in on various devices


   Ticket 2:
       Make various devices repositories and workflow be synced.
